Below contains a brief summary I have towards making Ravenfield mods:
1. Skin -- Making skins for this game should be the easiet to start with, as the very basic skin mod can be changing the texture of characters. Ability to model is required if 3d modification is ideal for creating the skin.
2. Maps -- Making maps for this game requires good modelling skill as well as texturing and lighting skill
3. Weapons -- making weapons for this game requires good 3d modelling skill as well as animation skill, texturing is required but can stay simple as weapons are usually in low-poly style. Ability to create simple logic is also required.
4. Vehicles -- making vehicles for this game requires good 3d modelling skill as well as animation skill and texturing. Ability to create advance logic is required.
5. Mechanics -- Creating or modifying game mechanics requires good understanding of all basic game logic.

Currently working on creating an weapon(Aug A1) for this game
